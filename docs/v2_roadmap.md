# V2 Roadmap: Extending the Framework to Undergraduate and MBA Programs

This roadmap outlines how the Career Intervention Signals framework
could be adapted for other student populations with different support
models and institutional constraints.

## Why V1 Focuses on Specialized MS Programs

V1 is intentionally scoped to Specialized MS programs to establish
clear assumptions around:
- high student-to-advisor ratios
- student autonomy
- scalable, system-driven interventions

Undergraduate and MBA populations require different timelines,
intervention mechanisms, and ethical considerations.

## V2: Undergraduate Programs

### Key Differences
- Assigned career advisors
- Earlier career exploration phase
- Greater need for proactive guidance

### Framework Adaptations
- Add `program_type = Undergraduate`
- Earlier milestone expectations (exploration, resume readiness)
- Advisor-initiated check-ins as a primary intervention
- Reduced reliance on observable engagement as a risk signal

### Example Interventions
- Required advising touchpoints
- Course-integrated career reminders
- Faculty-aligned communication during key academic milestones

---

## V2: MBA Programs

### Key Differences
- Employer-driven recruiting cycles
- Highly structured timelines
- Cohort-based placement dynamics

### Framework Adaptations
- MBA-specific recruiting calendars
- Employer engagement milestones
- Stronger emphasis on interview and offer-stage tracking

### Example Interventions
- Cohort-level readiness monitoring
- Employer-specific preparation workshops
- Offer evaluation and negotiation support

---

## Shared Principles Across All Programs

Despite differences, the following principles remain consistent:
- ethical use of student data
- transparency of assumptions
- separation of student support from outcomes reporting
- alignment with CSEA and First Destination standards

---

## Summary

The framework is designed to be extensible, not universal. Each program
type requires tailored assumptions, timelines, and intervention
strategies to ensure responsible and effective student support.
