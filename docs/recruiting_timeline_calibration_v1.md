# Recruiting Timeline Calibration (V1)

## Purpose
This document explains how recruiting timeline thresholds used in V1
(“On Track”, “Behind”, “At Risk”) were calibrated using **publicly
observable internship recruiting dates** and translated into a
program-relative timeline.

The goal is not to model individual employer behavior, but to establish
**defensible, transparent timing expectations** by career path that
support Career Services intervention while students are still enrolled.

---

## Program start date (anchor)
All timelines are anchored to the start of the Specialized MS program.

- **Program start date assumed:** August 25, 2025  
- **Week 1:** August 25–31, 2025

This anchor allows recruiting events to be expressed in
**week-in-program** terms rather than absolute calendar dates.

---

## Week-in-program conversion
For any publicly observable recruiting event date `date_i`:


Interpretation:
- Negative weeks: recruiting activity occurs **before** program start
- Week 1–2: very early fall recruiting
- Higher weeks: later points in the academic cycle

---

## Consulting — representative internship recruiting dates

Consulting timelines are informed by publicly posted internship
application deadlines aggregated by university career offices.

### Public sources (2025–2026 cycle)
- McKinsey & Company – Summer Business Analyst Intern  
  Application deadline: **July 17, 2025**
- Bain & Company – Associate Consultant Intern  
  Application deadlines: **July 6, 2025** and **September 2, 2025**
- Boston Consulting Group (BCG) – Summer Associate  
  Application deadlines: **June 23, 2025** and **September 3, 2025**

(Deadlines aggregated by university career offices for undergrad and
non-MBA master’s candidates.)

### Conversion to week-in-program (program start = Aug 25, 2025)

| Firm | Deadline date | Week-in-program |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| BCG | June 23, 2025 | -8 |
| Bain | July 6, 2025 | -7 |
| McKinsey | July 17, 2025 | -5 |
| Bain (round 2) | Sept 2, 2025 | 2 |
| BCG (round 2) | Sept 3, 2025 | 2 |

### Interpretation
- A substantial portion of consulting recruiting occurs **before**
  the academic program begins.
- A secondary window exists in **weeks 1–2** of the program.
- By mid-fall, most structured consulting recruiting has already
  occurred.

This supports **early and conservative thresholds** for consulting
timelines.

---

## Finance — general internship recruiting pattern

Finance recruiting follows structured but slightly later timelines than
consulting.

Representative employers:
- Goldman Sachs
- J.P. Morgan
- Morgan Stanley
- BlackRock

Public internship postings and campus recruiting calendars indicate:
- Early application windows in **late summer**
- Continued recruiting into **early fall**

Finance timelines are therefore modeled as **early but slightly more
forgiving** than consulting.

---

## Healthcare / Biotech — heterogeneous and rolling timelines

Healthcare and biotech internships show **high variability** by role
and employer.

Representative employers:
- Kaiser Permanente
- Johnson & Johnson
- Amgen
- Genentech

Publicly available program information indicates:
- Many healthcare internships recruit in **January–April**
  for summer placements.
- Some biotech and corporate healthcare roles post earlier, while others
  remain rolling throughout the academic year.

Example:
- Kaiser Permanente internships recruit **January–April 2026** for
  summer roles.
- Johnson & Johnson postings list February closing dates for summer
  internships.

Converted to week-in-program:
- January–February 2026 ≈ weeks **20–24**

### Interpretation
Because healthcare recruiting timelines vary widely:
- Thresholds are set **later**
- Emphasis is placed on **engagement visibility** rather than strict
  deadline adherence

---

## Tech — rolling and team-specific recruiting

Tech internships are characterized by:
- Rolling postings
- Team-specific deadlines
- Re-posting across multiple months

Representative employers:
- Amazon
- Google
- Microsoft
- Meta

Public postings typically span:
- Fall through spring
- With no single universal deadline

### Interpretation
Tech thresholds are calibrated to:
- Avoid early “At Risk” classification
- Emphasize pacing and visibility rather than fixed deadlines

---

## Threshold calibration approach

V1 thresholds are informed by **relative timing patterns**, not exact
employer dates.

Conceptually:
- **P50 (median):** recruiting is underway
- **P75:** most recruiting activity has occurred
- **P90:** recruiting is largely complete for that cycle

Operational rules use **conservative cutoffs** and require both:
- time-based lateness, and
- lack of observable engagement

before assigning “At Risk” status.

This reduces false positives while still enabling timely intervention.

---

## Scope and limitations
- Timelines are based on **publicly observable internship recruiting
  patterns**, not proprietary or USC-specific data.
- Individual employers may recruit earlier or later than these norms.
- Thresholds are intended to be **updated in V2** using institutional
  data (e.g., Handshake activity, surveys).

---

## Summary
This calibration approach provides a transparent, defensible method for
aligning Career Services interventions with commonly observed recruiting
timelines by career path, while acknowledging real-world variability and
data limitations.
