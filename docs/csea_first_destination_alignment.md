# Alignment with CSEA and First Destination Standards

This project is designed to support accurate, ethical, and defensible
career outcomes reporting aligned with standards such as CSEA and First
Destination surveys.

It does **not** replace formal outcomes reporting. Instead, it focuses
on the *upstream processes* that make high-quality reporting possible.

## Why CSEA and First Destination Matter

Organizations such as the Career Services and Employer Alliance (CSEA)
exist to address long-standing challenges in career outcomes reporting,
including inconsistent definitions, low response rates, and reporting
pressures driven by marketing rather than accuracy.

Following these standards helps institutions:
- protect data integrity
- inform students and employers responsibly
- maintain institutional credibility

## How This Project Supports Standards-Compliant Reporting

This framework contributes to CSEA- and First Destination–aligned
reporting in three key ways:

### 1. Improving Survey Engagement and Timing
By identifying when students are most likely to be engaging in recruiting
activities based on their intended career path, this project supports:
- better-timed survey outreach
- reduced non-response bias
- clearer expectations for follow-up

### 2. Creating a Culture of Assessment
The intervention logic demonstrated here emphasizes:
- regular monitoring of engagement signals
- transparency around where data gaps exist
- shared accountability for data completeness

This aligns with institutional goals to normalize assessment as an
ongoing process, not a once-per-year reporting exercise.

### 3. Separating Student Support from Outcomes Reporting
Student-facing support signals (e.g., workshop prioritization,
communication nudges) are intentionally separated from final outcomes
reporting.

Final employment outcomes would still be:
- aggregated
- validated
- reported according to CSEA and First Destination definitions

## Ethical and Operational Considerations

- No real student data is used in this project
- All student records are synthetic and clearly labeled
- Assumptions are documented and designed to be auditable
- The framework prioritizes student autonomy and privacy

## Institutional Use Case

In practice, a system like this would support collaboration between:
- Career Services
- Institutional Research
- Admissions
- External Relations

By improving upstream data quality and engagement, downstream reporting
for dashboards, publications, rankings, and accreditation becomes more
accurate and defensible.
