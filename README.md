# Career Intervention Signals

This project demonstrates how Career Services can use data to determine
**when and how to support Specialized MS students** based on their
intended career path and recruiting timeline.

The focus is on:
- smart communication
- workshop prioritization
- self-service clarity

This project uses **synthetic student data** and **publicly available
career outcomes references** to demonstrate ethical, scalable
intervention logic.
