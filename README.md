# Career Intervention Signals

This project demonstrates how Career Services can use data to determine
**when and how to support Specialized MS students** based on their
intended career path and recruiting timeline.

The goal is not to predict outcomes, but to support:
- smart, targeted communication
- workshop prioritization
- self-service clarity for students

## Why this matters
In high student-to-advisor ratio programs, individualized outreach is
not always feasible. This framework shows how data can be used to
deliver the *right information at the right time* at scale, while
respecting student autonomy.

## Scope (V1)
- Program type: Specialized MS
- Career paths: Consulting, Tech, Finance, Healthcare, Undecided
- Geography: Industry-based, not region-specific
- Data: Synthetic student records + public industry context

Industries with highly informal or network-driven hiring (e.g.
entertainment) are intentionally excluded from V1.

## Data ethics
- No real student data is used
- All student records are synthetic
- Assumptions are documented and transparent

## Standards context
This project is designed to *support*, not replace, formal career
outcomes reporting aligned with standards such as CSEA and First
Destination surveys.
